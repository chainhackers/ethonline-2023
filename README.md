# ProfitPals: Introducing Social Liquidity Mining

ChainHackers presents ProfitPals, our ETHOnline2023 entry, pioneering the concept of social liquidity mining in DeFi.

---

## Overview

ProfitPals aggregates liquidity via fund pools, managed by expert operators for optimized yield farming. Investors provide an anchor currency, minting share tokens as proof of stake.

### Features:

- **Fund Pools**: Managed by operators who employ best yield farming strategies using a trusted token list. Operators can also pause new investments as a safety measure.

- **Investor Interaction**: Investors mint share tokens by depositing anchor currency. These tokens enable permissionless withdrawals without the operator's intervention.

- **Protocol Control & Security**: Interactions are facilitated through the FundPool contract, ensuring predictability and a trustless environment.

Our ETHOnline2023 focus: integration with Uniswap and harnessing Safe smart wallets for the Fund Pool foundation.

## Development

Monorepo setup: smart contracts in root, frontend in its folder. We integrate Foundry/Forge with GitHub Actions for streamlined CI/CD.
